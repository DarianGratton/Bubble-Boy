# Bubblenaut
Game created for Vancouver Global Game Jam 2025

Bubblenaut is a game about an ant following his dreams and shooting for the moon, literally. You play as the Bubblenaut, who aims to ascend skyward to the moon inside a bubble. Collect bubbles to increase your speed, but beware, each one also makes your bubble bigger, and a single touch from anything else will burst it. Can you guide the Bubblenaut safely to his destination, or will you send them crashing down to their untimely demise?
