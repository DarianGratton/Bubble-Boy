# Bubblenaut
Game created for Vancouver Global Game Jam 2025

BubbleNaut is a 2.5D vertical climber where you play as a tiny yet hugely ambitious ant determined to reach the moonâ€”using nothing but a fragile bubble. Dodge falling debris, collect bubbles to gain altitude faster, and float to the rhythm of chill lo-fi beats. Will you guide BubbleNaut to his dream, or will he plummet back to Earth?
