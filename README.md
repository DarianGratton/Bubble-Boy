# Bubblenaut
Game created for Vancouver Global Game Jam 2025

Bubblenaut is a game about an ant following his dreams and shooting for the moon, litterally. You play as the Bubblenaut whose goal is to reach the moon rising in a bubble. [Something about collecting bubble to rise faster] Beware though, as touching anything that isn't a bubble will send the Bubblenaut down to his untimely demise.
